This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###
- This repo allows to perform bulk RNA-seqe analysis of transcriptome profiling done K562 as reported in this [paper]()
 - The K562 transcriptome are generated in K562 cells with the following conditions
   - ctrl -> control cell lines (treated with control siRNA)
   - KD -> endogenous MYB KD (treated with siU2992)
   - MYB Rescue -> rescue of endogenous MYB KD with ectopic expression of N-terminal TY1-tagged MYB
   - D152V Rescue -> rescue of endogenous MYB KD with ectopic expression of N-terminal TY1-tagged MYB with D152V mutation (that abrogates pioneering property of MYB)
   - 2KR Rescue -> rescue of endogenous MYB KD with ectopic expression of N-terminal TY1-tagged MYB with K503R and K527R mutations (that abrogates SUMO conjugation from MYB)
   - ANAA Rescue -> rescue of endogenous MYB KD with ectopic expression of N-terminal TY1-tagged MYB with V267NIV to A267NAA mutation (that abrogates SUMO binding from MYB)
- The transcriptome data for ctrl, KD, MYB rescue and D152V rescue can be found from GEO with accession ID: GSE85187
- The transcriptome data for 2KR rescue and ANNA rescue can be found from GEO with accession ID: GSE124542
